# Web-scraping-challenge

In this assignment, you will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following information outlines the steps to scraping information from a website and creating a web page using the data. 







## Scraping

Create a Jupyter Notebook file called mission_to_mars.ipynb. Use this file to complete all your scraping and analysis tasks. The following information outlines what you need to scrape.


### NASA Mars News

Scrape the Mars News Site and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.


### JPL Mars Space Imagesâ€”Featured Image


Visit the URL for the Featured Space Image site here.


Use Splinter to navigate the site and find the image URL for the current Featured Mars Image, then assign the URL string to a variable called featured_image_url.


Be sure to find the image URL to the full-sized .jpg image.


Be sure to save a complete URL string for this image.



### Mars Facts


Visit the Mars Facts webpage and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including diameter, mass, etc.


Use Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.



### Mars Hemispheres


Visit the astrogeology site to obtain high-resolution images for each hemisphere of Mars.


You will need to click each of the links to the hemispheres in order to find the image URL to the full-resolution image.


Save the image URL string for the full resolution hemisphere image and the hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. Use a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys img_url and title.


Append the dictionary with the image URL string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list will contain one dictionary for each hemisphere.
